This is the first draft of my new and awesome URL shortener using
the fastest hash table and hash function that I have been able to find.
Currently, it uses PHP for the redirect which as you know sucks but I will be making it better as time goes.

How it works:
1. Add URL using adder.sh <URL to shorten(without http://)>
2. It prints out the URL fragment assigned to your URL.
3. Execute "./redirect <url-fragment>" It prints out original URL.
4. Use the URL to do the redirect.
